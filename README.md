NHS Manager
===============

NHS Manager is an online platform adapted from existing Boostrap themes. Its job is to be a databank that stores and manages our school's Chapter of the National Honors Society members. All members must have required service hours to either tutoring or community-based service. These hours must be recorded and managed for all members. Chapter Officers have unique privilages that allow them to manage different aspects of the society. Those users are granted special permission to use NHS Manager for more sensitive material.

Requires SQL database for information. Configured database has a table called "nhs_members" with columns: username, password, token, studentname, role, tutoring, community, approved, and waiting.
