					<h2>Character</h2>
					<p>Character is what distinguishes one individual from another. It is the product of constant striving to make the right choices day after day. Students with good character demonstrate respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, fairness, caring, and citizenship in all of their actions.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<img class="img-circle img-responsive img-center" src="images/scholarship.png" alt="">
					<h2>Scholarship</h2>
					<p>Scholarship is characterized by a commitment to learning. A student is willing to spend the necessary time to cultivate his/ her mind in the quest for knowledge. This pillar can only be achieved through diligence and effort. Scholarship means always doing the best work possible, regardless of impending reward.</p>

				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<img class="img-circle img-responsive img-center" src="images/leadership.png" alt="">
					<h2>Leadership</h2>
					<p>Leaders take the initiative to aid others in a wholesome manner throughout their daily activities. Leaders sacrifice their personal interests in order to yield to the needs of others. Leaders need wisdom and self-confidence to affect change in all aspects of their lives.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-3">
					<img class="img-circle img-responsive img-center" src="images/service.png" alt="">
					<h2>Service</h2>
					<p>The pillar of service can be reached in a variety of ways. The willingness to work for the benefit of those in need without compensation or recognition of any kind is a quality that is essential in NHS members. As a service club, the National Honor Society is highly concerned with giving its all to the school and community at large.</p>
